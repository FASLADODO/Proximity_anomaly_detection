this is a matlab implement of "Proximity-Based Anomaly Detection using Sparse Structure Learning" Tsuyoshi et al. 2009
Requirement: L1General matlab interface

goTest.m is a quick script to show how it works.
By tracing goTest.m and modify the path to L1General in anomaly_detection.m, you should fully understand how it works quickly.
